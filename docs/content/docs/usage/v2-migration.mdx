title: v2 Migration
description: Migration guide from v1 to v2
layout: ../layouts/LegacyBaseLayout.astro

v2 introduces Svelte 5 support and an API overhaul to better solve the community requests during v1. To make the migration
easier, you can change all of your `svelte-modals` imports to `svelte-modals/legacy` which is a v1 wrapper around the new APIs. 
This should hopefully have no breaking changes, but please report any issues you find.

```svelte live 
<script>
  import { openModal, closeModal } from 'svelte-modals/legacy'  
  import MyModal from '../components/MyModal.svelte'

  function handleClick() {     
    openModal(MyModal, { title: "Alert", message: "This is an alert" })
  }
</script>

<button onclick={handleClick}>Open Modal</button>
```
